## Project Overview

**Finsight** aims to build a sophisticated multi-agent system that mimics the actions and behaviors of investors in a virtual stock market. By leveraging Large Language Models, we can create AI agents with diverse profiles and strategies that react to real-world news, policy changes, and market events.

The core goal is to uncover emergent patterns in trading behavior and evaluate how various factors influence market outcomes in a controlled environment, free from the data leakage issues that plague traditional backtesting. This platform serves as a powerful research tool for developing smarter investment strategies and enhancing financial decision-making tools.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Simulation:** A robust framework that supports diverse investor profiles (e.g., conservative, aggressive) and complex trading strategies.
- **Dynamic Event Integration:** Incorporates external factors like macroeconomic indicators, policy changes, and global events to influence agent decisions.
- **Leakage-Free Environment:** A carefully designed system that prevents agents from accessing future data, ensuring the integrity of simulations.
- **Visualization Dashboard:** An interactive dashboard to monitor trading behaviors, stock price fluctuations, and key agent performance metrics in real-time.
- **Behavioral Analysis:** Advanced modules to identify patterns and correlations between external events and trading outcomes.
- **LLM Evaluation:** A flexible architecture for evaluating and comparing the performance of different LLM-based agent configurations.
